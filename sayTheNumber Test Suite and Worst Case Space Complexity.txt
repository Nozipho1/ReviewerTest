TEST1:	
Print 100

GOAL:		
To see whether the method for printing 3 digit numbers includes 100, it does


TEST2:									
Initialise numbers as both integers and long numbers

GOAL:
To see whether both parameters work, no matter the value of the number, they do.

TEST3:
Initialise a number as a double to be printed

GOAL:
To see whether function includes doubles/floats in its implementation, it doesn't.

Worst Case Space Complexity:

One would need to create functions that work for each data type in order for the program to run. For example if I need the program to display decimals as well a separate function would need to be created for that just like with type long which type int falls under.
